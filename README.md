# Project Title

This Battleship game is a classic naval strategy game implemented in JavaScript.  

The game includes core classes for Ship, Gameboard, and Player, allowing for structured and testable code. Ships are created with specific lengths and can be hit and checked if sunk.  

Gameboards manage ship placement, track hits and misses, and determine the game's end condition. Players, including a simple AI for computer opponents, take turns attacking each other's boards. The user interface allows for interactive gameplay, displaying both player boards and handling user input through event listeners.

Additional features include cheat mode, game-over modals, and customizable player names. The game is designed to be easily extendable with extra features such as drag-and-drop ship placement.
